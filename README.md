- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DaGoblin

I am currently doing a Master of Information Technology at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia. In my professional career, I have learned VBA, mainly self-taught. So far in university, Iâ€™ve picked up the basics for C#, Javascript and NodeJS and looking to get a bit of python under my belt at some point.

From an interests point of view, Iâ€™m looking to get more involved with IoT and quite enjoy fiddling with my home automation setup built around home assistant.
