- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Phil Williams

I recently compelted a Master of Information Technology at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia. In my professional career, I have learned VBA, mainly self-taught. 

From an interest point of view, Iâ€™m looking to get more involved with IoT and quite enjoy fiddling with my home automation setup built around home assistant.
